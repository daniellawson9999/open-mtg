# OpenMTG - Env

This is my fork of Hlynur Davíð Hlynsson's [repository](https://github.com/hlynurd/open-mtg/issues), "An experimental framework for writing, testing and evaluating agents for the card game Magic: The Gathering.". Modifications are being made to support natural language based reinforcement learning.
