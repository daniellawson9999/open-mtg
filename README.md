# OpenMTG - Env

This is a fork of Hlynur Davíð Hlynsson's [repository](https://github.com/hlynurd/open-mtg/issues), "An experimental framework for writing, testing and evaluating agents for the card game Magic: The Gathering."

Modifications are being made to support natural language based reinforcement learning. Example usage can be found in env.py.
